                            <p className='weightSubText'>What is Semaglutide and How Does it Work?</p>
                            <div id='weightTopSection'>
                            <ul className='weightListContainer'>
                                <li className='weightListText'>Semaglutide is a prescription medication that is used to help with weight loss in adults who are overweight or obese.</li>
                                <li className='weightListText'>It works by mimicking hormones that your body naturally produces called incretin hormones.</li>
                                <li className='weightListText'>Incretin hormones are released by the small intestine and signal the brain, GI system, and other body systems that the body has consumed food and is ready to be metabolized.  This creates a feeling of satiety (or feeling “full”).</li>
                                <li className='weightListText'>Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. It works by mimicking the action of an incretin hormone called GLP-1, which is naturally produced by the body. GLP-1 helps to regulate blood sugar levels and reduce appetite.</li>
                                <li className='weightListText'>GLP-1’s are different from previous classes of prescription weight loss medications because they work on underlying metabolic pathways to help support weight loss.</li>
                                <li className='weightListText'>Semaglutide is given as a once-weekly injection, and it works by helping to control hunger and reduce the amount of food that a person eats. In clinical trials, patients taking Semaglutide lost significantly more weight than those who were given a placebo.</li>
                                <li className='weightListText'>It is important to note that Semaglutide should not be a substitute for healthy lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and it should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional. It may also cause side effects, so it is important to discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before starting treatment.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p className='weightSubText'>What is Tirzepatide and How Does it Work?</p>
                        <ul id='weightListContainer'>
                            <li className='weightListText'>Tizepatide works much like Semaglutide, however, it works on both GLP-1 and GIP receptors.</li>
                            <li className='weightListText'>The GIP receptor (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) is a protein found on the surface of certain cells in the body.  This receptor is activated by the hormone GIP which is released by the small intestine in response to the presence of food.</li>
                            <li className='weightListText'>Clinical trials have shown that Tirzepatide can lead to significant weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes and those without diabetes.</li>
                            <li className='weightSubListText'>In a trial including patients with type 2 diabetes, those who took Tirzepatide lost an average of 12.4% of their body weight over 72 weeks, compared to 2.4% for those who received a placebo.</li>
                            <li className='weightSubListText'>In another trial, people without diabetes who took Tirzepatide lost an average of 11.5% of their body weight over 26 weeks.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className='weightSubText'>It is important to note that Semaglutide or Tirzepatide  should not be a substitute for healthy lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and it should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional. It may also cause side effects, so it is important to discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor before starting treatment.</p>
