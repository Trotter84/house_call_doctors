              Where It All Started

            <SubText>
              <p>
                Dr. Mark Cacciamani began his medical career in a clinic setting where he was often unable to spend adequate time with his patients.<br />He realized during this clinical experience that his place was not with the "worried well" and he wanted to make a bigger difference in healthcare.<br /><br />He founded House Call Doctors in 2004 which allowed him to serve home-bound patients that would not otherwise have access to adequate health care.<br />Dr. Cacciamani's passion to bring better health care to the home-bound population is instilled in all of House Call Doctors' staff and we strive to better the quality of life for each of our patients.
